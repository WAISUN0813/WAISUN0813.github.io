            <p>
                My name is WAI SUN LAM. Welcome to the my OVERCOOKED!2 website! This site is dedicated to one of the most exciting and chaotic cooking simulation games in the world.
                Here, you'll find information about the game, its history, rules of gameplay, and tips to become a master chef in the virtual kitchen.

                I'm a passionate gamer and web developer who fell in love with OVERCOOKED!2 from the first moment I played it. I spent a lot of time in high school playing this game with my friends, and it gave me many unforgettable memories of my childhood. 
                As a web developer, taking part in this project allowed me to not only celebrate my love of gaming, but also to incorporate these memories into the design and development of the website. 
                I wanted to provide an experience that not only captured the core of the game, but also evoked fond memories of playing with friends.
